They also perform judicial police duties. </p>

Today the Civil Guard also performs duties in cities, but its main function is border control and road traffic supervision. It is also responsible for the outer perimeter of prisons and penitentiaries (civil servants called ‘prison officials’ are in charge of what goes on inside these facilities) and the transfer of prisoners from one prison to another or to the Courts. They also perform judicial police duties. </p> <img alt="100%x180" src="images/virtual/03.png" class="rounded leftie">

Catalonia’s regional police force is called the Mossos de Escuadra. They wear a blue uniform and perform the same duties as the National Police and the Civil Guard within their territorial bounds, including the external surveillance of prisons. All of these competences, except for border control which remains the responsibility of the Civil Guard, have been devolved to that Region. They also perform judicial police duties. </p> <img alt="100%x180" src="images/virtual/04.png" class="rounded rightie">

They wear a red uniform and exercise the same authority as the police in Catalonia with the exception of the external control of prisons which is still entrusted to the Civil Guard as that competence has not been devolved. They also perform judicial police duties. </p>

One must never forget that the effectiveness of rights does not depend only on the letter of the law but fundamentally on the freedom and financial capacity to be able to exercise those rights. This is something that was not always available to women. </p>

																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> It was the Bar Associations that first tackled the problem by signing agreements with the various public administrations to fund an assistance service for battered women. This service covered two needs. On-duty lawyers organized in much the same way as assistance for detainees providing immediate 24/7 legal support as well as consultant lawyers to advise on the steps to follow in the event of a problem. On-duty lawyers helped women to take the initial steps to deal with physically dangerous situations. </p>
                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> Then, once a legal procedure was initiated against the person accused of mistreatment, women could continue under a private prosecution regime. That was the point where the second inequality occurred, in many instances because the intervention of a lawyer was not mandatory and in others because many women ostensibly had sufficient means given that the calculation was based on family income. These women were therefore not entitled to free legal assistance. </p> 
                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> This problem was solved by the 2004 Comprehensive Measures against Gender-based Violence Act. That law entitles women, from the very outset, to assistance and a lawyer to help them file a police complaint. A shelter is also provided for them and their children and a restraining order is issued to keep the aggressor from getting within a certain distance. In conclusion, the law entitles women to free legal assistance from the very outset, regardless of whether the intervention of a lawyer is mandatory and insufficiency of financial means is presumed by default. </p>

In principle, they have the same rights as Spaniards. Consequently, they are entitled to legal counsel if detained and to have an interpreter present when making their declaration. They also have the right to appoint a lawyer of their choice for subsequent legal proceedings. But interpreting services are only available at those specific times and it is quite likely that certain aliens may not understand enough Spanish to properly know their rights and how to exercise them. It is also very likely that their income, if any, is insufficient to cover the costs of a legal proceeding. </p>

These services were provided by volunteer lawyers and financed by the government under agreements signed with the Bar Association. The Bar Associations’ services for immigrants provided legal advice to aliens and instructed them on how to defend their rights. They provided them with an interpreter and, when necessary, defended their interests. </p>																						
                                                                                        <img alt="100%x180" src="images/virtual/14.png" class="rounded rightie">
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> The 1996 Free Legal Assistance Act was an important step forward in recognizing the right of aliens in Spain who lack sufficient financial resources to obtain free legal assistance. Moreover, the Free Legal Assistance Act gave aliens the right to such assistance from the very outset in the jurisdiction of the administrative courts, without having to file any paperwork, and the right to address matters related to their stay in Spain or expulsion orders. </p>
                                                                                        <img alt="100%x180" src="images/virtual/15.png" class="rounded leftie">
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1">  While this system solved the problem for aliens already in Spain regardless of their legal status, it did not solve the problems facing immigrants under “Organic Law 4/2000 of 11 January 2000 on the rights and freedoms of aliens in Spain and their social integration”, also known as the Alien Act, regulating the legal regime applicable to aliens in Spain and their social integration and explicitly referring to irregular aliens arriving at our borders. Such aliens are sent to Alien Internment Centres (Spanish acronym CIE) where they must wait until a decision is made regarding their situation. They are entitled to free legal assistance and legal representation by a lawyer. </p>

But does not deprive them of all their rights. The other rights of incarcerated persons remain intact and may continue to be exercised from prison. For instance, these persons can marry and divorce, buy or sell a house, draw up a will or accept an inheritance, file a lawsuit or defend themselves against one filed against them, request free legal assistance, etc. </p>

It must comply with the provisions in the General Penitentiary Act, Law 1/79 of 26 September 1979 and its Regulations of 1981 and 1996. This was the first law passed after the Constitution came into force and serves as proof of the importance attached to this issue after 40 years of dictatorship. </p>																						
                                                                                        <img alt="100%x180" src="images/virtual/17.png" class="rounded rightie">
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> According to the Penitentiary Code where these regulations can be found, inmates may request the opportunity to exercise the specific rights provided for under said Law (temporary release permit, communications with family members, conjugal visits, changes in custody status to a more open regime, filing of complaints against sanctions imposed in prison, etc.). Inmates may also file a complaint before the judge overseeing their sentence if requests made to prison officials have gone unanswered or been denied. </p>
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> It has become clear that the effective exercising of these rights, including access to effective justice, is contingent upon inmates’ imprisonment status. Lawyers have detected this problem and in the 1990s created the so-called Prison Guidance Service (Spanish acronym SOP). This resulted in the signing of an agreement with the government whereby Bar Association lawyers are permitted to provide legal counsel inside prisons to inmates who so request, and defend their requests through administrative or judicial channels.  </p>

                                                                                        <img alt="100%x180" src="images/virtual/02.png" class="rounded rightie" />

This is a Public Defence system in which the State directly guarantees court-appointed defence through the creation of Public Defender Offices that hire a number of lawyers for a period of time to perform these duties.</p>

There, the State does not appoint a lawyer but rather entitles defendants to an amount of money deemed appropriate to pay for their defence. With that assured amount of money, defendants engage the lawyer of their choice and if the latter is satisfied with the arrangement, he or she takes the case. If the lawyer in question charges more than the sum allocated, the defendant may either pay the difference out of pocket or find another lawyer willing to accept the amount offered.</p>

It falls upon the accusing party to prove that the defendant, who is considered innocent for the duration of the proceeding, has actually committed the crime in question. The addition of “in dubio por reo” (in case of doubt, defendants shall be favoured), makes the judge’s obligation clear if there are doubts about whether or not the accused has been proven guilty. In this latter case, the judge must rule in favour of the accused. </p>
                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> Hence, the essence of criminal procedure lies with the accuser and not the accused, since it is the accuser who bears the entire burden of proof with regard to the guilt of the accused. Prosecution in Spain can be public, private or private by a party unaffected by the alleged offence, or even a combination of two or all three of these. </p>
                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> Public accusation is brought by a prosecutor on behalf of the State in defence of legality. The result of this basic obligation to defend legality is that at times the role of prosecutors rather than to accuse but rather to somehow defend the innocence of the accused when it is considered that guilt has not been proven in due form. </p>

Every crime produces a victim who can be a personal or criminal victim when physical or property damages have been suffered, or civil when damages are economic in nature. </p>
                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> In any case, all victims have the right to take an active part in criminal proceedings by filing a private accusation. This is done either to bolster the prosecutor’s position and support the request for a conviction in which case the sentence is usually higher than that requested by the prosecutor, or to simply claim greater civil liability compensation from the accused for damages suffered than the those requested by the prosecutor. </p>
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> And lastly, private accusation may be brought by a party unaffected by the alleged offence. This form of accusation is brought by individuals or associations that, while not direct victims of a specific crime, can be considered to be affected by its social impact. This is common in the context of urban planning due to environmental risks that may arise, in terrorism, and in political corruption as these offences affect the whole of society. </p>

                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> It was in the 19th century, the 12th century of the Muslim era, when this charitable work became a professional duty in Spain. The so-called ‘defence of the poor’, officially named as such because it required a prior declaration of poverty by a judge, became an obligation for all lawyers, an “honourable duty” of the profession: compulsory and free, provided by lawyers with no remuneration. </p> 
                                                                                        <p class="text-larger lh-1"> It was at the end of the 20th century of the Christian era, the 13th century of the Muslim era, when this professional obligation became a right; when charity became into law. </p>
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> This change occurred when the Spanish Constitution of 27 December 1978 declared the right of all Spaniards to equal access to justice and to the right to legal defence, which implies being able to freely choose a lawyer to defend one’s rights (Article 24(2) of the Spanish Constitution—SC) or to have one appointed by the court for people who do not have their own lawyer (Article 545 Organic Law of the Judiciary—LOPJ) or who lack the financial means to pay for such services (Article 119 SC). </p>
																						<p class="text-larger lh-1"> Free legal assistance was the culmination of that process in Spain.</p>
